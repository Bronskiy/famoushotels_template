<p>As the only organization dedicated to the history of hospitality, The Most Famous Hotels in the World researches the past of historic hotels.</p>
<p><p>
<b>The Library</b><p><p>
In 1986 we published the first book about the history of <b>one</b> hotel as a book. This book was to become the first book in the series THE MOST FAMOUS HOTELS IN THE WORLD®. It was about Raffles Hotel in Singapore.
<p>
Ever since we are publishing new titles every year. Hoteliers interested in employing us to produce a book about their hotel can visit  <b><a href="/article/1034/" title="Making a book about a famous hotel">this site</a>.</b></p>
<p><p>We produce informative, entertaining and educational books about historic hotels, aiming at a wide target audience with a commitment to giving the past a powerful contemporary relevance.</p>
<p>All our books are constantly updated and have become a valuable tool of marketing for the hotels involved.<p>
<p>We concentrate in particular on the history of individual hotels all over the world, researching historic components with experienced thoroughness. This always leads to compelling results, focusing on important events and of course important guests who have made history.</p>
<p>To turn these efforts into market orientated tools of sales and PR we help historic hotels to develop the asset &#8216;history&#8217; as an unique selling point.</p>

<div class="caption" style="width: 200px;"><img src="/images/uploads/pileofbooks.jpg" alt="image" width="200" height="240" /><p>The pile of books is growing as you are reading&#133;</p></div>
Our production of books about THE MOST FAMOUS HOTELS IN THE WORLD makes up the library on the history of individual hotels. We love our job. Careful research and lovingly detailed work, combined with an informative and entertaining story, are accompanied by unique photography.<p><p>
<b>The List of Famous Hotels, The Jury</b><p>
We report appropriate hotels to an independent jury (only hotels meeting the criteria of the jury. See: <a href="/site/hotel/suggest/" title="Suggest a new hotel">Suggest A New Hotel</a>).</p> </p>

<h2>Our Mission<br />Frequently Given Answers</h2>

<p class="question"><b>What is &#8220;The Most Famous Hotels in the World&#8221;?</b></p>
<p class="answer">There are hotels of outstanding historic significance in the world. Since 1986 we professionally research the history of these hotels.</p>

<p class="question"><strong>How do you select famous hotels?</strong></p>
<p class="answer">People from all over the world tell us about them. We find them. Sometimes they are reopened after years of neglect. We present them to our independent jury. They finally select the hotels, each of which can call itself a &#8220;Select Member of The Most Famous Hotels in the World&#8221;. All select hotels can be found under &#8216;<a href="/hotels/" title="Hotels">HOTELS</a>&#8217;.</p>

<p class="question"><strong>Has the &#8220;Famous Hotels&#8221; listing created a new historical awareness in our industry?</strong></p>
<p class="answer">Since 1986, the picture has changed dramatically! The presentation of the history of a hotel has been recognized as a sustainable asset and a competitive advantage. Well researched history has become one of the most valuable tools of sales and marketing. Books and related material have created a new means of identification. A well researched and verified history is one of the corner pillars of a successful marketing strategy.</p>

<p class="question"><strong>How do you make your historical research?</strong></p>
<p class="answer">&#8220;The Most Famous Hotels in the World&#8221; is specialized in the global historic research and production of fine books about this subject. The team is taking care of this field since 1986, having researched and written the histories of many notable establishments. The archives of the organization in Vienna holds files of all hotels.</p>

<p class="question"><strong>Production of books - How does this work?</strong></p>
<p class="answer">We are invited by one of the most famous hotels in the world to undertake a complete research of its history. The result is an elegant, individual book. Since 1986, each book becomes part of a library called &#8220;The Most Famous Hotels in the World&#8221;. Since 2006 (Grand Hotel Royal, Budapest) we also build exhibitions. Since 2011 we install THE PATH OF HISTORY, a permanent history exhibition, in our partner hotels.</p>

<p class="question"><strong>How does the hotel benefit from the books?</strong></p>
<p class="answer">Each hotel has its own book about its past and current history. These books have become a very unique PR and sales tool. The leather bound editions, for example, are - needless to say - also a prestigious VIP give-away. This income secures the financial support of the organisation &#8220;The Most Famous Hotels in the World&#8221;.</p>

<p class="question"><strong>What are The Friends of The Most Famous Hotels in the World?</strong></p>
<p>A respectable number of admirers of famous, traditional hotels. We receive their applications by postcards from our books and of course here over the web. Please visit our page &#8216;<a href="/friends/" title="Friends">FRIENDS</a>&#8217;.</p>
